# mathematical-computation
This project looks into providing applications of various algorithms for computing mathematical functions in Python. 

Due to the intended application of these algorithms, these are designed without reliance on Python libraries - though, it should be noted, the algorithms could likely be improved through the use of libraries.

## CORDIC
The first algorithm of interest is the CORDIC algorithm.
